# UTI Agent Evaluation & Continuous Improvement

## LLM Response & Clinical Decision Evaluation

The UTI agent is set up to log comprehensive session data in structured JSON format. This includes *conversation logs* (user interaction and agent response with metadata) and *clinical decision logs* (treatment recommendations and referrals with full reasoning). This **session logging** acts as the foundation for agent eval and continuous improvement of the system.

Building on this logging foundation, we can create an automated evaluation pipeline that tracks the following:
- **Response Quality Analysis**: Secondary LLM evaluates conversation logs for empathy, clarity, and clinical appropriateness
- **Decision Audit Trails**: Clinical decision logs enable retrospective analysis of treatment patterns and guideline compliance  
- **Conversation Flow Metrics**: Track completion rates, question repetition, and user engagement from conversation sequences
- **Safety Event Detection**: Pattern matching and anomaly detection flags unusual decisions for human review

Based on this, we can track and update key metrics relevant to the performance and quality of the agent. This may include:
- **Clinical Safety**: Referral rate (track against target), false negative detection, treatment guideline compliance
- **LLM Performance**: Parsing accuracy (>90%), response appropriateness scores, fallback usage rates
- **User Experience**: Conversation completion rate, average session length, user satisfaction scores

## Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation Framework

Building upon this automated evaluation pipeline, we can involve relevant stakeholders in the evaluation loop as follows:
- **Clinical Reviewers**: Licensed primary care physicians and nurse practitioners review 5-10% of weekly cases, focusing on complex presentations flagged by automated systems. The objective is to provide timely guideline updates (if any) and to adjust the sensitivity of referral rate.
- **Patient Feedback**: Post-session surveys capture user satisfaction on clarity, confidence in recommendations, and treatment outcomes. Optional follow-up tracking monitors treatment effectiveness and adverse events.
- **QA**: developers conduct monthly/quaterly reviews of referral patterns, safety events, and treatment compliance against established guidelines.


## Using Evaluations to Improve Quality & Safety

- **Immediate Safety Actions**: Clinical reviewer feedback triggers immediate updates to referral thresholds, contraindication checks, and safety protocols when patterns of concern emerge.
- **Iterative Prompt Refinement**: Based on patient feedback and clinical reviewer insights, identify confusing patterns and make systematic LLM prompt improvements to enhance symptom extraction accuracy and response clarity.
- **Conversation Optimization**: User completion rates and satisfaction scores guide A/B testing of different question sequences and response styles to reduce abandonment and improve user experience.

## Engineering & Deployment System

### Core Infrastructure
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Real-time log processing feeds automated metrics dashboards and clinical review queues
- **Review Dashboard**: Web interface for clinicians to efficiently review flagged cases and provide structured feedback
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Controlled deployment of prompt variations and conversation flow changes to subsets of users

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staged Rollouts**: New improvements deploy to 10% of users for 1 week monitoring before full release.
- **Automated rollback** triggers if safety metrics (referral rate >40%, parsing accuracy <85%) deteriorate.
- **Continuous Integration**: Weekly improvement cycles incorporate clinical feedback, update LLM prompts, and adjust decision thresholds based on collected performance data.
